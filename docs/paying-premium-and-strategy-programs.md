# Paying Premium and Strategy Programs

A premium must be paid in the form of USDC on a regular interval of two weeks to keep one's reinsurance. Failure to pay the premium post its due date by more than two weeks may result in the Liquidity pool calling off the reinsurance. The premium to be paid to the reinsurer is equal to the premium paid to the insurer minus the commission the insurer takes. The first premium shall be due at the time of commencing of the reinsurance. These premiums would go towards a premium vault on which strategy programs may act.&#x20;

Strategy programs are generic programs with a defined interface that may be created by anyone. These programs may then be proposed and voted upon by the Liquidity pool token holders in a similar manner as for reinsurance proposals, though the voting end time is two weeks rather than a month. These programs include the amount of money to be streamed to them from the premium vault(in which the insurer sends money), and in how many intervals over what timelines. Money is streamed to the strategy program in hopes of allocating money in such a way as to reduce the risk taken by the reinsurer.

For example, a codebase reinsurer for an ML(machine learning) project may stream money to a program that distributes this money to people who solve security issues in common ML libraries. In this way, the reinsurer takes up an active role in preventing damage over merely insuring against it.

Any money left in premium vaults after the pool lifecycle has ended would be assumed to be LP pool profit and will be re-distributed to LP token holders as rewards along with their initial USDC/USDT investment.
